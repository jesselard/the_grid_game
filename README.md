Computer finds optimal path to reach reward

One a 3x4 board, the computer starts at the lower left space (3,1). The computer then moves to find the optimal path to 1 (the reward), while avoiding -1, the negative reward. The center space, zero, cannot be moved through. 

Then the percentage of probabilty of the computer getting to the reward by path is displayed in each element.
